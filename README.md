# school_project_4800
Designed a modern Building Maintenance System to replace slow manual processes for rental property companies.
This team project created a full system blueprint for real-time maintenance requests: tenants submit issues easily, managers prioritize (high/medium/low with deadlines), and crews track/update tasks. Includes secure user roles, cloud hosting (Django + Google Cloud), notifications, and privacy compliance. My sections: System Request (business needs/value/risks) + International/Global factors (multi-language, regulations)
